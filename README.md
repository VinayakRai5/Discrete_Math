# Detecting Anomalies in the Crypto Market
This was created as a third semester Discrete Mathematics (CS201) Course Project by Aarsh Desai, Priyesh Gupta, N.V.J.K Kartik, Vinayak and Vivaan Sharma. The project aims to identify and classify the different types of scams prevalent in the cryptocurrency market as of Dec 2022.

Our project consists of mainly two ideas:

i) Scraping of datasets from online crypto resources such as Binance

ii) Identification of the specific times when scams have occurred and to trace their timelines.

In due course of making our project, we were able to identify three peculiar types of anomalies and relevant scams within the existing state and rules of the crypto market.

The anomalies we decided to focus on were:

a) Price anomaly

b) Volume anomaly

c) Number of trades anomaly

The classifications we drew from the data were:

a) Pump and Dump schemes

b) Market Manipulations

c) Total Scams
